# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, which comes under the supervised learning technique. 
It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. 

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
